# AuxCrypt

**AuxCrypt** is an auxiliary stream cipher scheme for the YSC2 cryptographic suite.

This cipher features an internal structure completely distinct from YSC2, characterized by a unique design that repeatedly applies a Lai-Massey structure to an internal state interpreted as a 4-dimensional hypercube.

## ðŸš€ Purpose

The primary purpose of AuxCrypt is to provide an additional layer of security when used in conjunction with YSC2. For example, a keystream generated by AuxCrypt can be used as an auxiliary input to the YSC2 sponge construction to further strengthen domain separation or key derivation processes.

## ðŸ“– Design Details

- **Internal State**: 1024-bit (16 x 64-bit words)
- **Non-linear Function**: `f(x) = (Â¬x) âŠ• (x <<< R_A) âŠ• (x <<< R_B)` (bitwise NOT, XOR, and rotation)
- **Structure**: 4-dimensional Lai-Massey
- **Backends**: Supports both `soft` and `simd` backends, same as YSC2.
